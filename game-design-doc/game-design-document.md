# Overview

Show how skilled you are and survive the waves of incoming spaceships! The more you survive, more points you get!

# Story

The war is coming and everyone is trying to become a *space shooter*. 

Why? The Military Defense needs the best pilots to win the war so they created a *virtual mission* to test your skills! 
The best shooter will be awarded with infinite pizza and beer for the rest of his life.

Play *Space Shooter* and take the highest score to show the Military Defence who is the best!

# Gameplay

The gameplay is an infinite side-scrolling shooter where enemies randomly appear and start firing at you.

Your objective is to survive and destroy as much enemies as you can to get points.

# Mechanics

## Spaceship movement

The spaceship can move in all directions (with a joystick or WASD) but it can't go outside the boundary of the screen.

## Fire bullet (no powerup)

If the player presses down or holds the fire key, a bullet will spawn in the spaceship position and will move to the direction it's facing.

## Bullet collision with enemy

If one enemy collides with the bullet:

- the bullet disappears
- the enemy receives a damage (see [Enemy receives damage](#enemy-receives-damage))

## Spaceship Life

The player starts with 3 lives (they need to be always visible during gameplay in the GUI).

If the player loses all the lives, the lose the game.  
See [Gameover](#gameover).

## Gameover

TODO

## Spaceship - receive damage

The player receives damage on:

- enemy collision
- enemy bullet collision

 ![Spaceship state diagram](./img/spaceship-states-diagram.png)

If the spaceship is in `Idle` state and it takes damage:

- it loses one life
- it goes immediately into `Recovery` state

When in `Recovery` state:

- the spaceship ignores all the collisions with objects that cause collisions
- the spaceship graphic flashes continuosly (modulation to absolute white)
- a timer is started and after `recovery_time` seconds (eg: 3 seconds), the spaceship transition into the `Idle` state

## Spawn powerup

After an enemy has been killed, it has a x% chance of spawning a powerup.

The powerup slowly moves towards the scrolling direction and disappears (it's destroyed) when it goes out of the screen.

## Collect powerup

The player can collect a powerup simply by touching it.

## Fire bullet - Powerup1

With this powerup, the bullet is larger and deals more damage to enemies.

## Enemy spawn

Enemies can spawn in different ways. The type of spawn depdens on the enemy.

There are different wave movements and formations, randomly selected at the start of each one.

TODO: give more details

## Enemy receives damage

- The enemy sprite flashes to white quickly one time (eg: take a look at Cuphead for reference: https://youtu.be/MivqpCN-AsE?t=108)
- The enemy loses HP the depending on the bullet strenght (see [Bullets damage](#bullets-damage))
- If enemy's HP are less or equalt to 0, the enemy is defeated (see [Enemy defeated](#enemy-defeated))
